Who keeps track of copy-on-write when we have more than 2 processes referencing the same VA?

How physical memory address unwrapping works (not portable on Manolis laptop)?

How .so (dynamic libraries) ask for memory regions on startup, how that relates to heap if library calls malloc?
Is this so multiple processes that use the library have same Virtual Address mapping on the library, despite maybe different
physical addresses on not shared data?
