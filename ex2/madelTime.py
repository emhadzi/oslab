# I want to plot the average time taken to complete mandel for each case of n and m
# Please create a 3D plot of the average time taken to complete mandel for each case of n and m
# The x-axis should be n, the y-axis should be m, and the z-axis should be the average time taken from 3 attempts
# We would like to plot for integer values of n from 1 to 10 and m from 1 to 70 with a step of 10
